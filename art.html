       Rehearsals began with the cast mid-January, and my team and I quickly went to work! My team consisted of myself (Production Stage Manager), Leah Martinez (Stage Manager), Tula Banks (Assistant Stage Manager), and Alex Gaffin (Production Assistant). After a week of tablework, the team and I taped out the set, and retrieved the (rehearsal) scenic peices the director desired. Throughout the rehearsal process, I took down blocking notes (PDF below) and worked with my team to create tracking lists, run lists, and forms for the show. As we blocked through the show, I practiced calling sound cues with Leah Martinez (SM), who I delegated to run sound for the rehearsal process. I was also in consistent correspondence with the team for The Seagull, including costume designer Emily White, program designer Jacqueline Brown, props manager Zach Blumner, lighting designer Nic Vincent, Assistant Principal of Drama and Dance, Greg Sinicori, and Assistant Principal of Technical Theater and Carreer and Technical Education, Elijiah Schreiner. I was in communication with the team to send out information and scheduling details.

        As the PSM of Mr Lobenhofer's Senior Drama One Acts, I was in the rehearsal room from Day 1, as the class decided what shows they wanted to perform for their first performance in the Little Flower Theater. Prior to rehearsals I set up all of my paper work and all templates, so that the instant the shows were chosen I was able to jump right into action. At the start of official rehearsals for each of the three One Acts I organized a meeting with each student director, going through the script and going over sound, lighting, props, and set ideas, sending in requests daily through my collective rehearsal reports (examples below). I sent in all requests for costumes and all costume inspiration into Amelia Dombrowski, the costumes teacher at LaGuardia. I took actors in for costume fittings, tagging all costumes and organizing them on a seperate rack. I was responsible for taking blocking notes, for three different shows all rehearsing at the same time in the same space, and I sucessfully took all notes down. I also collected requests from all the directors, sending out one rehearsal report at the end of each day. During rehearsals, I was also responsible for collecting requested props and rehearsal-set-pieces. I worked in the rehearsal room from the beginning of September through the beginning of December, going into the theater to begin spacing and teching on December 5th. We loaded into the theater the same day we moved in, as there had been a performance in the theater the night before. I aided in moving in all set pieces from the rehearsal room, while also collecting the remaining props and set peices, and loading them into the theater. I organized two props tables backstage, working on a place to preset each set peice to allow for seamless transitions. During tech, I worked with lighting designer Damani Pompey, and sound designer Seviin Cruz to number cues, adjust volumes, and adjust lighting to where the actors land. I built my call script, and after several runs in the theater, we did our last dress rehearsal the night before the show, and performed for a nearly full audience where we performed a bequtiful show, and I called it sucessfully. I learned application of knowledge, independence, and resiliance, being able to work hard with little support, and being able to suceed despite many challenges shows my own strength and organization, I have a lot of love for this show, and I always will.

        Throughout the rehearsal process, I was in charge of filling out rehearsal reports (a few examples are shown below). This included making a detailed run down of events, and taking absolutely any notes necessary, as well as taking attendence and marking down latenesses. Fun Home had a lot of complicated blocking and choreography, so it was incredibly important to film certain numbers for cast and crew reference. As with blocking, props were a major component of this show, with dozens of props traveling across the stage throughout the show, often times very quickly and all at once. I was in charge of tracking props during the rehearsal process, who brings the prop on, from where, where it ends up, what it's used for, etc. Towards the end of rehearsals, I also was set up to take down line notes during full runs.

        This show followed a 1-2-2-1 form, with PSM Avril Leykam, SM's Chiara Hodge (me) and Qishan Chen, ASM's Maggie Webster and Finn Buckley, and PA Frank Raso. We were brought into the rehearsal room in early January, opening the show on May 14th, and closing on May 16th. While in rehearsals I was put in charge of taking attendence, as I was first to memorize names, and I was put on the task of retyping the dialogue where the directors wished to make changes. The entire stage management team rotated being in charge of adding to the rehearsal report. We rehearsed every day until 6:00, going later and later as we got closer to the show. I was positioned Stage Left for the run and tech of the show, with ASM Finn Buckley. During the run of the show I was focused more on ushering actors where they should be, going off of my PSM's direction, whether that was calling an hour to places, to making sure people weren't lingering in the halls. Because of this stage management team, we were able to make sure actors got in and out of costume efficiently and get to exactly where they needed to be when they needed to be there.

        As one of three Stage Managers for Our Town (led by PSM Talulah Lamentrie), I oversaw plenty of paperwork and was able to step in as a PSM as need be. I was the floater SM, which meant that I was able to be on call for anything and wasn’t restricted to stage right or stage left. I was in rehearsals from December until April, our tech rehearsals and run being in the first week of May. During rehearsals, I oversaw getting actors out to get costume fittings and hair and makeup meetings. I worked with our costume designer, Sophia Dorio, and our head of hair and makeup, Leah Martinez to make this run quickly and smoothly. I would time rehearsals and film run-throughs for reference. I helped with blocking notation, and communication with our props head, deck head, and Technical Theater instructors to answer questions and get information. During tech and the run of the show, I managed actors coming on, assisted with deck moves, and was able to hand off props. Preshow, I made sure everyone had the costume pieces they needed on and helped preset the show. During intermission of the show, I would go up to the lobby, where the actors were (we had an wedding-reception themed intermission, as Act One of Our Town ends in a wedding). Once they’d finished their short performance in the lobby, I oversaw getting them all back downstairs for costume changes, which was a difficult task as the lobby was crowded, and the actor’s friends and families were drawn to talk to them. Post-show, I helped reorganize our props table and clean up from the night. I made sure to get everyone out of the dressing rooms and theater and didn’t leave until after the remainder of tech and all the actors left. Below I have pictures of the stage, from backstage, and of the production.
